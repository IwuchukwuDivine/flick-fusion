# Movie Website

Welcome to the Movie Website repository! In this project, I've created a movie website using HTML, CSS, and the TMDb API. This project was inspired by tutorials from [CodeWithSadee](https://www.youtube.com/@codewithsadee) on YouTube, where I learned how to fetch movie data from the TMDb API and build a responsive movie website.

## Features

- **Movie Discovery**: Explore a vast collection of movies, including popular, top-rated, and upcoming releases.
- **Detailed Information**: Each movie comes with detailed information such as synopsis, release date, ratings, and cast.
- **Trailer Playback**: Watch trailers for selected movies directly on the website.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for specific movies using keywords.
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a seamless browsing experience across different devices.

## Usage

To use the Movie Website:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Browse and discover movies using the provided features.
4. Click on a movie to view detailed information and watch trailers.

## Future Improvements

While the current version of the Movie Website offers a range of features, there are several areas for potential improvement and expansion:

- **User Authentication**: Implement user accounts and authentication for personalized recommendations and watchlists.
- **Rating and Reviews**: Allow users to rate and review movies, and display aggregated ratings.
- **Customization**: Provide options for users to customize their browsing experience, such as setting preferences and filters.
- **Social Sharing**: Enable users to share their favorite movies with friends on social media platforms.
